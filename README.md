# Covid-19-Impact-WorldWide
## Objective
Analyse Covid-19 and its impact globally from 2019 till Sep 2022.
## DataSet
[Here is the Link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

The dataset has been divided into different tables named Covid-Deaths and Covid-Vaccinations to work around sql queries better for analysis.

## Tools Used

PGAdmin â€“ PostgreSQL Management Tool for the Analysis [SQL Queries](https://github.com/korharleen/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/portfolioproject.sql)

Tableau for Data Visulaization [My Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/harleen8610/viz/ImpactofCovidGlobally2020-2022/Dashboard1)

I have worked on seperate [SQL Queries](https://github.com/korharleen/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/tableaufiles.sql) for data to create dashboard.

## Personal Note
So this was my very first project. Yes very intimidating initially I struggled with very basic things like ,took 5-6 hours just to import my data files to sql,
understanding pgadminn interface , then offcourse the main part was analysis ,I have felt like whatever I have learnt so far has come into practice I experienced 
how sql or tableau  can make such huge data useful.I can write so much in this section somehow controlling.

Big Big Thanks to [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst) for this wonderful project.
